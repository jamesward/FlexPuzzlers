       A)


       B)


       C)
       c = Infinity
       d = 0


       Answer: C
       Reason:
        - anything / 0 doesnâ€™t throw an error. This is a pretty serious code screwup, and itâ€™s nice to know when it happens. But instead of throwing an error, it just sets the result to Infinity, at least if youâ€™re storing it in a Number.
        - storing the result of x/0 in an int results in 0. So basically, casting Infinity to an int gives you zero. This is actually where my bug was, because I was storing the result of an operation (which incorrectly assumed the denominator was nonzero) into an integer, and resulted with a value of 0 which threw all kinds of things off.
