	What does the list visualize for the following code:

	    var result:Array = [1, 2, 3, 4];
	</mx:Script>
	
	<mx:List dataProvider="{result}" />
	
	A)
	Four items: 1, 2, 3, 4
	
	B)
	One item: [1,2,3,4]
	
	C)
	One item: [object Binding]
	
	D) Compile error
	
	
	Answer: C
	Reason: This is a bug in the code generation within Flex.  A function is generated that creates functions for resolving bindings.  In that, there is an auto-generated variable named "result" is a "Binding" object and takes over the scoping of the function.
	
	// Code generated by Flex compiler
	private function _BindingToResult_bindingsSetup():Array
	{
	  var result:Array = []; //<======= variable named result auto-generated
	
	  result[0] = new mx.binding.Binding(this,
	    function():Object
	    {
	      return (result);   //<======= Reference to what is supposed to be our result, but is not
	    },
	    null,
	    "_BindingToResult_List1.dataProvider"
	  );
	
	  return result;
	}
